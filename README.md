# Deliveroo

This is a deliveroo clone app with major functionalities using React Native, Redux, Tailwind CSS

# Create project with expo

npx create-expo-app deliveroo

# Install Stack navigation

# Configure Tailwind

Add tailwind to the babel file

# Some TailWind Hacks

Use className to use tailwind
text-gray-400 change text color text-xs change textsize
flex-1 take up whole space as flex
flex-row is flex direction row
items-center center the items
space-x-2 gives space on x axis so does mx-4
pb-2 is padding bottom 2
rounded rounds the image
relative makes it relative to that view
absolute means absolute lol
h-7 w-7 height is 7 as well as width

# Use hero easy icons with react native

use the Name on the website as well use size and color attributes

# Just a small organising tip

folder names should be small and file name in each folder should start with capital and camel case the exports should be same name as the file names
